# Solution Explanation

This solution demonstrates a simple yet functional implementation of a 2-factor authentication code input in React. Users can input a secure 4-digit code with intuitive behavior, and it's ready for integration into a larger authentication system.

### Code Explanation

- The `useState` hook is used to manage the state variable code, which stores an array representing the 4 code input fields.
- `inputRefs` is an array of useRef objects that are used to create references to the input fields.
- `handleInputChange` is a function that handles input in each field. It checks if the input is numeric, updates the state, and advances the cursor to the next field if not in the last field.
- `handleBackspace` is a function that allows users to press backspace to delete a digit in the current field and focus on the previous field.
- `submitCode` function validates the entered code against a hardcoded code and shows the code to an `alert`, it can be further replaced by any action such as External API call.

### Styling

- The inputs are styled with a width and height of `40px` and aligned to the center of the container.
- A gap of `10px` separates the input fields to position them next to each other.
- A submit button is positioned below the input fields.
